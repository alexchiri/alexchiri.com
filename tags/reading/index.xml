      <description>Some months ago I was writing about a routine I setup to manage and refresh highlights from books and articles. In the meantime, I have adjusted it a little bit, removed some services and added some others. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the bits that didn&amp;rsquo;t work that well.
Highlights from articles As much as I liked the flow with sending articles weekly from Pocket to Kindle using a service named aptly Pocket2Kindle, I soon became swamped with articles pending on my Kindle.</description>

      <description>In the last years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a fair amount of books. Besides that, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to read more interesting articles and blogs, which is why I started using Pocket for almost a year now. At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;ve kept trying all kind of routines that would make me remember more from what I read. In the next paragraphs, I&amp;rsquo;m going to describe what I am currently doing and although it is not perfect, it feels the best so far, considering I don&amp;rsquo;t have much time to invest in revisiting these reads.</description>

      <title>My reading routine</title>

      <description>Fiction or non-fiction? I’m always on the lookout for new things, so I’m constantly reading and learning stuff. I noticed that I cannot read always non-fiction, because it is usually harder to digest, so I only do that in the morning (usually in the subway ride to work) when my mind is fresh.
At the same time, if I only read non-fiction, I feel like I am always thinking about the things I am reading and my mind doesn’t get to disconnect.</description>

      <description>Intro I have to say, I usually don&amp;rsquo;t read a lot of fiction or fantasy books, as in, I rarely go and search for a specific fiction book in a store. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I don&amp;rsquo;t like the genre, but I seem to feel guilty because I don&amp;rsquo;t read something &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; instead. There&amp;rsquo;s also the search of something to read, going through top 10 lists, New York Times best sellers list and so on.</description>
