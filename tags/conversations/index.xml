      <description>We all have difficult conversations everyday, be it with someone who steps in front of you in line or with your boss asking for a raise. Sometimes they don&amp;rsquo;t end as we would have liked it, right?

How many times we think that the other party is to blame of the result? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s normal, our self-conservation instinct does that to protect us of bad feelings. But that is not generally a good thing, because at the same time cancels any type of self analysis.</description>
