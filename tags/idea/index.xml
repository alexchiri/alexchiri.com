      <description>I have an idea about a revolutionary recipe website. Yeah, you read it right, a recipe website. Being a software engineer, you would think that it should be easy for me to build it and launch it, basically it&amp;rsquo;s something I do every day for my employer. But as you might have found out, shipping is not that simple.
Stuck in preparation I had this idea for several years now and I started to make it happen, I think, about 4 or 5 times.</description>
