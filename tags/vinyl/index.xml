      <description>A bit of history I started using my parents old russian vinyl player when I was a bit older than 3 years old (or so I was told). We had a few tens of vinyls, most of them &amp;lsquo;classics&amp;rsquo; like Harry Belafonte, Elton John, Roxette, Abba and a bunch of children stories recorded for the radio, sometime in the &amp;lsquo;60s or &amp;lsquo;70s.
You could guess which were my favorites at that time, I knew them by heart and a day wouldn&#39;t pass without the player &amp;lsquo;booming&amp;rsquo; with children stories.</description>
