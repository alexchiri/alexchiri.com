      <description>I am always wondering how would it be if people wouldn&#39;t take holidays anymore.
Holidays always seem like the pleasant parts of life, where you get to travel, to spend more time with your family, to enjoy yourself more, to &amp;ldquo;recharge your batteries&amp;rdquo;. Once you&#39;re back to work, you need to readjust to the chaos, the routine and all that &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; entails.
Why does it have to be like this? Why can&#39;t you work and do holiday activities on a continuous basis, therefore removing the need for holidays?</description>

      <description>Maybe you&#39;ve heard about Joel Spolsky, or maybe his blog domain joelonsoftware.com sounds familliar. No? Nevermind!
He seems a smart and open minded person and he managed to (co-)found quite some cool companies, which gave birth to some really cool products (Stack Exchange or Trello anyone?)
He recently came back from his blogging retirement with an article about Trello. While I think Trello is a very good product, I was a bit more interested in the company culture reminded in his article.</description>
