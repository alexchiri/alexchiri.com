      <description>One of the main ideas of the famous TV show, House M.D., was that in order to generate good ideas, you have to challenge yourself or have people to challenge you at every step.
And I think this is the most valuable lesson which that show has to offer and it repeats it in every damn episode, for the duration of 8 seasons! It must be good!
Leaving House aside, challenge, if it&amp;rsquo;s done in a constructive manner, it is very productive, otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s just &amp;lsquo;contra&amp;rsquo;.</description>
