      <description>I had a Pebble Steel watch for over a year now, but never took the time to put together an app or a watchface for it. Recently, I started testing RescueTime out of curiosity to see how much of my time is spent on &amp;ldquo;productive&amp;rdquo; things and how much on not so productive things.
Not much later I found myself refreshing the RescueTime dashboard every now and then to see how much I score on their stats.</description>
