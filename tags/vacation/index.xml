      <description>I am always wondering how would it be if people wouldn&#39;t take holidays anymore.
Holidays always seem like the pleasant parts of life, where you get to travel, to spend more time with your family, to enjoy yourself more, to &amp;ldquo;recharge your batteries&amp;rdquo;. Once you&#39;re back to work, you need to readjust to the chaos, the routine and all that &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; entails.
Why does it have to be like this? Why can&#39;t you work and do holiday activities on a continuous basis, therefore removing the need for holidays?</description>
