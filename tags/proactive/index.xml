      <description>Just a few things I read this a couple of days ago about reactive/proactive:
&amp;ldquo;Our behaviour is a function of our decisions, not our conditions&amp;rdquo;. If we choose to blame others for our conditions, we become reactive. &amp;ldquo;Proactive people are driven by values - carefully thought about, selected and internationalised values&amp;rdquo; while &amp;ldquo;Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment&amp;rdquo;.
Reactive language:
 * There&#39;s nothing I can do.</description>
