      <description>In the last years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a fair amount of books. Besides that, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to read more interesting articles and blogs, which is why I started using Pocket for almost a year now. At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;ve kept trying all kind of routines that would make me remember more from what I read. In the next paragraphs, I&amp;rsquo;m going to describe what I am currently doing and although it is not perfect, it feels the best so far, considering I don&amp;rsquo;t have much time to invest in revisiting these reads.</description>
