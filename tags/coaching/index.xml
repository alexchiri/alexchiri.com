      <description>Book details  Author link: http://www.boxofcrayons.biz/the-coaching-habit-book/ Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BUIBBZI/ My rating: ★★★★☆  Some thoughts The book is an elaboration of a simple trick: try to listen more and ask questions, rather than directly giving advice. I enjoyed the lecture of the book and the explanations of the 7 questions. Like all this kind of advice, I believe it is worth starting practicing the original questions to get an understanding of what are their effects and then start coming up with your own questions that have the same effects.</description>
