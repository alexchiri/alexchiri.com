      <description>Some months ago I was writing about a routine I setup to manage and refresh highlights from books and articles. In the meantime, I have adjusted it a little bit, removed some services and added some others. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the bits that didn&amp;rsquo;t work that well.
Highlights from articles As much as I liked the flow with sending articles weekly from Pocket to Kindle using a service named aptly Pocket2Kindle, I soon became swamped with articles pending on my Kindle.</description>

      <description>In the last years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a fair amount of books. Besides that, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to read more interesting articles and blogs, which is why I started using Pocket for almost a year now. At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;ve kept trying all kind of routines that would make me remember more from what I read. In the next paragraphs, I&amp;rsquo;m going to describe what I am currently doing and although it is not perfect, it feels the best so far, considering I don&amp;rsquo;t have much time to invest in revisiting these reads.</description>
