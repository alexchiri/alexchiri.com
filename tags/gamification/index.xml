      <description>Dust has settled on my blog lately. Writing stuff for the Internet is not my priority, no matter how much I enjoy it. I did decide to try something though: to briefly write about interesting things I found out every month. Like a newsletter about nothing and about everything, a mixed bag of new and old things I think are worth sharing. So here it is: Interesting!, Novâ€™16 edition!
Contents  * Octalysis, an actionable gamification framework * Self-deception and why it is so important for leaders and not only * Cynefin (pronounced _ku-nev-in_) framework for decision making * Slickyboards and Slickynotes, cheap convenient alternative for home whiteboards and static post-its  Games and what can we learn from why we play them Understanding what motivates people to do things is a pretty interesting problem.</description>
