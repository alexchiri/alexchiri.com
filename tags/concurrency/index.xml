      <description>Java 7 puts on the table some new tools for concurrency and its family of Executors. Here&#39;s my attempt of exemplifying their usage with a small bank robbers analogy.
Here&#39;s the thing: let&#39;s say you are a team of bank robbers and you want to pull up a heist on a bank. A team means multiple members and each can carry so much bags of money. Let&#39;s put in code a Heist, a Bank with not enough security and using the new ForkJoinPool, let&#39;s parallelize and distribute the tasks between robbers.</description>
