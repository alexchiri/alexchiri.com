      <description>The third day of LAScot was a little bit shorter for me, because I chose to come back to Stockholm on the same day. That gave me just enough time to see the keynote and @JoakimSunden’s talk about the “Spotify Model”.
Keynote: Awesome Superproblems by Luke Hohmann (@ LukeHohmann) Luke’s keynote was very inspiring. He demonstrated how our experience in building products and services can be used in other domains and parts of life.</description>

      <description>One of the tricky parts of LAScot was getting hold of the tokens for tracks 3 to 5, which were not filmed and required a token to get access. Or you could “risk” it and drop by anyway, maybe someone changes his/her mind or there is some room left. In all the workshops I’ve been at, there were always extra people accommodated into the room.
These being said, on the first day I completely forgot about the tokens, although I was pretty early in the conference centre.</description>
