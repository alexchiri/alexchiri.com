      <description>Here I am, at the end of the YourTurnChallenge! Uuuhuu, what a ride! __
I was pleasantly surprised to see that since about the half of the challenge I stopped using the list of subjects I prepared beforehand because I had other ideas I wanted to write about and those felt better than the ones on the list. That makes me feel very good about myself because I proved that I don&#39;t need to worry much about what to write as long as I write.</description>

      <description>Maybe you heard, maybe you didn&#39;t, but there&#39;s a new challenge in town!
It&#39;s called Your Turn Challenge and it&#39;s initiated by Winnie, the Special Projects Lead for Seth Godin. Now, it doesn&#39;t really matter who drives it, I&#39;ve been wanting for some time to increase the number of my blog posts and get them coming in a more regular fashion.
The challenge consists in blogging every day of next week.</description>
