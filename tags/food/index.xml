      <description>Fancy a delicious evening snack, but you don&#39;t want to feel too guilty about the extra calories?
Then I present you the Crunchy-Tomato-Garlicky-Madness!!! Isn&#39;t that a tongue twister? Never-mind, I still have to work on the marketing part, I&#39;ll figure it out later.
Ingredients Now go grab from your local grocery store the following and get munching (2 portions):
 1 large sized tomato (with the least plastic as possible) crackers / hard bread (more fibre, less unhealthy stuff) 3-4 cloves of fresh green garlic (not that frozen ages ago Chinese crap) chives dried tomato paste (optional, brings some extra flavour kick, also calories) shredded old cheese flakes (optional, but&amp;hellip;) olive oil lemon juice / vinegar salt  The process Get 2 crackers and put a thin layer of the tomato paste on them.</description>
