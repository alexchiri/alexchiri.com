      <description>Book details  Author link: https://www.radicalcandor.com Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kim-Scott/dp/B01KTIEFEE My rating: ★★★★★  Some thoughts Radical Candor or something with similar principles is essential for everyone to use in the work place to create connections with the others and learn and improve. It is also something that can require a lot of conscious effort to accomplish. But also to some it comes naturally in part. While reading the book, I remembered situations from my experience when I could&#39;ve reacted in a better way.</description>

      <description>Book details  Author link: https://arbinger.com/ Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GUPYRUS/ My rating: ★★★★☆  Some thoughts I think The Arbinger Institute are on to something. It is still not 100% clear for me how someone gets in the box in the workplace, but I can definitely recognise the situation where one would throw trash at the company, without a clear understanding of why and what is the actual problem. It is easier to throw trash at something or someone else than criticising yourself.</description>

      <description>Think of one of your employees. Imagine he asks you the following: how would you sell my job position to me, if I would be a candidate to be hired for it?
Would you be able to answer with an empty conscience?
What feedback would you get from your employee?</description>

      <description>By accident, like most of the books I read, I stumbled upon Stephen Covey&#39;s book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. It&#39;s one of those books, it&#39;s not enough to read them, or at least not just once, but you also should think deeply about the ideas in them and apply them into your life.
It&#39;s not the first time I mention Covey&#39;s book, I have shared fragments from it and even gave an extremely short summary of the main concepts:</description>

      <description>Some of these things are so simple that are easy to ignore, other are a little bit too abstract to act on them right away. It depends on each of us to act on the things we believe in, to make it our mission to fight for our ideas. Millions of books have been written about these subjects, yet most of the modern workers continue to ignore them. I’m going to add another drop to the ocean of recipes of presumed success, here it goes, take it with a bit of hope:</description>

      <title>What makes a leader</title>
      <link>https://alexchiri.com/2014/10/19/what-makes-a-leader/</link>

      <description>Like I probably said before, I read quite a lot of books, especially business and self-help books. I found out a few weeks ago about Daniel Goleman&amp;lsquo;s new book, What makes a leader?. The book is basically a collection of posts he did on Harvard Business Review along the years, starting with the one that has the same title as the book and was initially published in 1998.
The trouble with all these books is that if you don&#39;t do something concrete with them right away, you&#39;ll probably forget most of their content.</description>
