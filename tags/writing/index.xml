      <description>Context, context, it&#39;s all about context I started a little while ago to write a book. Yeah, I know, who would have thought, right? But that&#39;s besides the point.
Initially I used a writer specific app for Mac called Ulysses and while the app is really great, it has two disadvantages:
 * it is available only for Mac (and maybe in the future for iOS) * not geeky enough (I know this is a stretch for a second reason, but hey!</description>

      <description>We are creatures of habit. I’m sure you heard this expression before.

But it’s actually true. We need routines and habits to give structure to our life. Of course, there are a few rebels out there, who are decided to live every day in a different way, but I’m sure that even they have a routine in their craziness.
We build routines around things we HAVE to do (or feel uncomfortable about) and they start with small things that we LIKE to do, just to compensate.</description>
