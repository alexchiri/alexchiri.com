      <description>Sadly this was the last day of Jfokus and it was pretty cool!
Magic tricks with Git Third day of Jfokus started brilliantly with a very cool talk about Git given by Tim Berglund of DataStax.

      <description>Internet of things and things of Internet, Keynote I decided to try something different and so go to the IoT Keynote: IoT - an evolution from Internet of Screens to Internet of Things, done by Pawel Ostropolski from Intel. Basic gist: smart and connected devices are getting cheaper and cheaper and spread to all domains. In other words, they are becoming ubiquitous. It is now in the power of almost everyone to improve their life and the life of others by using technology.</description>

      <description>Hello, 2016, this is the microservices calling Microservices is one of the biggest buzz words of the moment. Being a very beginner in this topic, I decided to focus mostly on it through the Jfokus conference this year.
Chris Richardson&amp;rsquo;s tutorial, Introduction to microservices was comprehensive, taking us through the basic concepts, patterns and strategies behind them. Without going too much into details, there was lots of useful content and the presentation consists a good base to understand what are microservices about and give you several points to continue to find out more on your own.</description>
