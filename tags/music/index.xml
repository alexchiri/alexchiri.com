      <description>There are were and are a lot of discussions about Spotify not paying fair the artists for the number of streams that their creations get in the music streaming network. Now, to be honest, I don&#39;t know if Spotify is fair or not, there&#39;s plenty of pro articles as well as against this topic, but that&#39;s besides the point.
Let&#39;s say that Spotify doesn&#39;t pay fair, let&#39;s just assume that this is the uncontestable truth.</description>
