      <description>&amp;hellip; you get this strange feeling, you sort of feel disoriented.
Maybe in our case was because things happened quite fast. Today we are in the apartment we lived for 3.5 years, 2 days later is completely empty and the morning after we hand in the keys to the agency, get in our car and drive away.
I was never really attached to things or places, but you develop habits and routines like using the same place to put your keys when you get in or the path you always take when doing your morning jogging.</description>

      <description>Immigrant life: reboot! So here we are, changing the type of the statistic we are. After 4 years and a few months since my wife and I were counted as moving in to The Netherlands and Amsterdam, we will be counted as leaving.
There&amp;rsquo;s nothing out of the ordinary in our decision. Different groups of friends told me that&amp;rsquo;s the norm, after 4 years in the country of tulips, you either stay quite longer or you leave.</description>
