      <description>I don’t know about you, but in my experience until now, there were situations where I felt micro-managed. And I hated it. Badly. It frustrated me. I didn’t understand why I was treated like that and I didn’t like the implications it had on the perceived quality of my work.
Doesn’t my boss think I’m capable? If you’re someone who cares about their work, having a boss who micro-manages you is not a good sign.</description>
