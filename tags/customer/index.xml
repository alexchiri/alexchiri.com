      <description>Seth Godin explains the difference between a client and a customer
&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;The customer buys (or doesn&#39;t buy) what you make. The client asks you to make something. The customer has the power to choose, but the client has the power to define, insist and spec. &amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;  It&amp;rsquo;s an important distinction to make. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard these terms being used pretty often with simply the meaning of the person/company that pays for a service or a product.</description>
