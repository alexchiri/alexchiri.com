      <description>I have been recently reading about performance and what makes you better. The term of &amp;lsquo;deliberate practice&amp;rsquo; popped up more than once.
I&amp;rsquo;m halfway through the book Talent Is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else by Geoff Colvin and I found quite some interesting things while reading it.
We all know that in order to get better at something we have to practice. Well, it seems that it is not enough and in order to get best results we should engage in something called &amp;lsquo;deliberate practice&amp;rsquo; in a study from the &amp;lsquo;90s.</description>
