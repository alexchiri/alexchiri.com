      <description>I have discovered Alan Watts a few days ago and since then I have been going through the Youtube videos with his lectures. I like his way of putting things into words, it&amp;rsquo;s a pleasure to listen and to think about his ideas. Here&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorites that could be resumed to one simple idea: carpe diem!

I have tried to make a transcript of this video, couldn&amp;rsquo;t grasp a couple of words, sorry for that!</description>
