      <description>There are were and are a lot of discussions about Spotify not paying fair the artists for the number of streams that their creations get in the music streaming network. Now, to be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if Spotify is fair or not, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of pro articles as well as against this topic, but that&amp;rsquo;s besides the point.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say that Spotify doesn&amp;rsquo;t pay fair, let&amp;rsquo;s just assume that this is the uncontestable truth.</description>
