      <description>Maybe you heard, maybe you didn&amp;rsquo;t, but there&amp;rsquo;s a new challenge in town!
It&amp;rsquo;s called Your Turn Challenge and it&amp;rsquo;s initiated by Winnie, the Special Projects Lead for Seth Godin. Now, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter who drives it, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting for some time to increase the number of my blog posts and get them coming in a more regular fashion.
The challenge consists in blogging every day of next week.</description>

      <description>Having a small blog where you can ramble about whatever you want should be a simple thing, right? I mean you don&amp;rsquo;t pay much to the host, they have installation scripts for any platform you like, you just buy a domain (if you want) and you start writing! Well, that&amp;rsquo;s only in theory, at least for me.
It all started a few months ago with my domain alexchiri.ro just disappearing from the records of my host at that time, icebluehost.</description>
