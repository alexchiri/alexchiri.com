      <description>Story maps is a concept made popular by Jeff Patton and he started using them professionally before he even started to call them story maps. They were born from the need of having a better way of approaching complex agile projects, one that gives them a better chance to be successful.
They&amp;rsquo;re not sliced bread But they&amp;rsquo;re really close. I&amp;rsquo;ve started using story maps a few months ago and I find them a very useful tool.</description>
