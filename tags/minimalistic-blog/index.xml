      <description>Not much to say about this. Felt like implementing something in 1-2 hours and this seemed like a good candidate. So here it goes, I now have RSS feed, I only need readers and will to write.</description>

      <description>When I started working almost daily with ReactJS a few months ago, I was pretty challenged (still am) with all the different modules to use and the concepts that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t used with in the Java world. So I thought of a fun side-project with ReactJS to learn more and try some of the &amp;ldquo;crazy&amp;rdquo; things I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really use at work at that point. Because I wanted to be able to do some link-blogging as well and Ghost (or any of the themes I liked) didn&amp;rsquo;t facilitate it I decided to go wild and build my own blog in ReactJS.</description>
