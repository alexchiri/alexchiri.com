<p>I have an idea about a revolutionary recipe website. Yeah, you read it right, a recipe website. Being a software engineer, you would think that it should be easy for me to build it and launch it, basically it&rsquo;s something I do every day for my employer. But as you might have found out, shipping is not that simple.</p>

<h2 id="stuck-in-preparation">Stuck in preparation</h2>

<p>I had this idea for several years now and I <em>started</em> to make it happen, I think, about 4 or 5 times. I liked spending time preparing, I bought a domain and I started thinking about a logo for the website. But making a logo was not as simple as I thought, at least not one that I liked. I needed to find the <em>right</em> software to make it and find the <em>right</em> moment to do it. After some time I ended up with a logo I was pretty much happy with, but I was pretty discouraged about how much time it took to get there. So I abandoned it for a while.</p>

<p>After that, whenever I wanted to learn a new technology I used my idea as an excuse to play with that technology. So that is the reason why I have one version started in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, one in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> and one in <a href="https://grails.org/">Grails</a> and all abandoned more or less in the beginning. And thinking back, I was pretty much always <strong>stuck in preparation</strong>, finding different excuses to not work on the <em>important</em> and <em>difficult</em> things, the ones that mattered the most.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-level">The next level</h2>

<p>Few months later after the last try, I sort of gave up on the idea of building it, but I felt like writing, so I said, hey, why not write about a fictional company which is busy building this revolutionary recipe website of mine. I get to write about things related to software development and about my idea. So what do you think I did first?</p>

<p>Correct! I bought a domain for the fictional company to use it for the book I was about to write. Afterwards I decided I need to choose the <em>right</em> fonts and find the <em>right</em> platform to make sure I can easily generate the book in any format I could think of. And that took a while. I got pretty well informed about the tools I would need to write the book, but I didn&rsquo;t get to write anything. __</p>

<p>After another break and some time later, I restarted the thing, did some character sheets and wrote <a href="http://www.alexchiri.com/post/the-live-deployment-stories-from-bitopia/">one small chapter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-point">The point</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re probably wondering by now, what is the point with this story, have you found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana">Nirvana</a> or something?</p>

<p>The point I wanted to make is that not even when you have an idea that <strong>you</strong> believe is worth pursuing, things won&rsquo;t be easy. Some go chasing for ideas their whole life and maybe do not find them and others think they have an idea but get <strong>stuck in preparation</strong>.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s why challenges like YourTurnChallenge make a difference, because they help us prove to ourselves that we can <em>ship</em>, that we can <em>deliver</em>, but we have to start working with the <strong>important</strong> things and not with the cherry on top.</p>
