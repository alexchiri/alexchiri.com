<p>In this workshop we had a short introduction to the Theory of Constraint and the Current and Future Reality Trees. Afterwards, we received a case (you can download it from <a href="https://02f3b4b6141f4e501887-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/ToC-TheTeamFromHell.pdf">here</a>) that we should read and try to identify UDEs and intermediate effects.</p>
<p>From there, we attempted to build our own Current Reality Trees using post-its. I found this to be an interesting technique to determine root causes to different problems you have in an organisation. It needs some practice, as it gets pretty easy to get confused with which effects are intermediate or UDEs. But once mastered, I can imagine it is a very useful tool to understand problems or situations you encounter, which don‚Äôt have an obvious solution and can be more difficult to crack.</p>
<p>Bellow are the notes I made and some of my photos. An excellent short description of the Theory of Constraints, the slides from this workshop and further references can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@Skyscanner/you-cant-predict-the-future-but-you-can-shape-it-f19314442d29">here</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the interesting details about how agile is being introduced into ad agencies and the data about what people value in agile (see below), the workshop gave me something to think about how I want to be perceived and how I am currently being perceived by my co-workers. Might seem a small thing, but I think it‚Äôs a pretty important detail.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8162-1024x583.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We were organised in 3 groups, one group at each table. We started the workshop by writing on post-its different things we got positive feedback for and share them around the table. Next step was to write things we want to be recognised for. <strong>Did the 2 sets of notes overlap or was there a gap?</strong></p>
<p>In the next activity, we shared in groups of 2 our name, our role, what is our passion and we are doing about it. In the second round, one of us would make everything in his/her power not to listen to the other. Some even left the room or were speaking with other attendants. <strong>How did that affect the others who were trying to communicate with the ones avoiding communication?</strong></p>
<p>Following up, we gathered the most common topics that came up during retros in our own companies. Per each table, we picked one of the most common topic in the group and tried to brainstorm and come up with solutions to it. Anything that came into our mind, we would just put it on the wall. Next, we rotated tables, so each group would be facing another group‚Äôs post-its. It was time to try to group, remove, combine, add or modify the post-its done by the owners of the post-its. We did one round, so each group‚Äôs post-its have been visited by the 2 other groups. <strong>How easy was it to identify one solution for our initial topic?</strong></p>

<p>John‚Äôs talk was pretty intense and his slides contained plenty of information so I limited myself to taking photos mostly. I will put them below and add his slides here, once they are available.</p>
<p>I think that burnout and depression is a serious problem that affects many people in the IT and/or knowledge work environments. There are many factors that contribute to this situation and at the same time, it is pretty difficult to notice and prevent, especially in a culture of continuous exponential growth and ‚Äúalways busyness‚Äù. There is not much awareness about the signs or causes of the burnouts, which is why I decided to join John‚Äôs presentation.</p>

<p>What is burnout?</p>
<blockquote>‚ÄúA psychological syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and reduced personal accomplishment‚Ä¶ as emotional resources are depleted workers feel they are no longer able to give themselves at psychological level‚Äù - Christina Maslach
<p>‚ÄúBurnout really is a response to stress. It‚Äôs a response to frustration. It‚Äôs a response to a demand that an individual may make upon themselves in terms of a requirement for perfectionism or drive.‚Äù - Herbert J. Freudenberger</blockquote></p>
