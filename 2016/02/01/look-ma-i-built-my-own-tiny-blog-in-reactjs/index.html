  <div id="content">
    <p>When I started working almost daily with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">ReactJS</a> a few months ago, I was pretty challenged (still am) with all the different modules to use and the concepts that I wasn&rsquo;t used with in the Java world. So I thought of a fun side-project with ReactJS to learn more and try some of the &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; things I couldn&rsquo;t really use at work at that point. Because I wanted to be able to do some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linklog">link-blogging</a> as well and <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> (or any of the themes I liked) didn&rsquo;t facilitate it I decided to go wild and build my own blog in ReactJS. A blog that would slowly include all the things I would want!!! Exciting, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>The first obstacle I had was what to begin with? There are sooo many (really, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=react%20starter%20kit">so many</a>) starter kits out there for ReactJS that it was pretty overwhelming for a complete n00b. I followed <a href="http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html">terop&rsquo;s tutorial</a> (and what a good tutorial!) and that gave me an idea of the basic bricks of ReactJS world. I kinda liked the idea of <a href="http://isomorphic.net/javascript">isomorphic</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9">universal</a> apps so I started looking around on my favourite source of inspiration: <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>After some time, I found <a href="https://github.com/RickWong/react-isomorphic-starterkit">Rick&rsquo;s starter kit</a> and decided it&rsquo;s something I would like to use as a base. Not for my blog project, but for my-own-yet-another-react-starter-kit, which I called <a href="https://github.com/alexchiri/isomorphic-from-scratch">isomorphic-from-scratch</a>. I called it like this because while I started from Rick&rsquo;s repo, I really wanted to understand how things are working in it and adjust it to my like it. Which I did!</p>

<p>1-2 weeks later, I was satisfied with what I had and use my kit to start the blog project, <a href="https://github.com/alexchiri/minimalistic-blog">minimalistic-blog</a>. And my focus was on getting it working in a very basic shape. I&rsquo;m not a CSS guy, so I kept things very, very, very minimalistic, as long as they were working.</p>

<p>Some more time later, I got to a stage I like, which does the minimal things I want to have in order to put it live. Which simply meant to be able to list create, edit posts and link-blogging.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty much where I am now. In the next period, I will take some time to add documentation and write a few posts about my findings, add tests (yeah, I didn&rsquo;t write one single test), update the admin interface to look decent and keep up with the latest versions of everything.</p>

<p>One of the things I am proud of, as a JS n00b that I am, is the <a href="https://github.com/alexchiri/isomorphic-from-scratch#authentication">authentication</a> approach I took for the blog. While there&rsquo;s plenty to improve, I like the simplicity of it. Is it super super super secure? Probably not. But I think it is more secure than the average starter kits out there which include authentication.</p>

<p>If you took the time to read until here, do reach out! I&rsquo;m interested to hear what you think about this. As you probably noticed, there&rsquo;s no menu, or contact links or anything. He he, who needs &lsquo;em? 😁 You can give me a ping on <a href="https://twitter.com/alexchiri">Twitter</a>, I&rsquo;m looking forward to your feedback! 👍😊</p>
